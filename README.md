## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website, app, or interface. It serves as a blueprint for designers and developers, laying out content, structure, and functionality before any coding or visual design begins.

##  Why is Wireframing Important?

Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process for several reasons:

- **Clarifies Ideas**: Helps transform abstract concepts into tangible layouts.
- **Improves Communication**: Acts as a visual communication tool between stakeholders, designers, and developers.
- **Saves Time and Resources**: Identifies potential design and usability issues early, reducing the need for rework later.
- **Focus on User Experience (UX)**: Prioritizes user needs and behavior before aesthetic elements are introduced.
- **Facilitates Feedback**: Provides a clear, editable structure that invites early feedback and iterations.
